# UC Irvine
+ Sports Analytics
    +
    Analyzing NBA shot chart data with Professor [Weining
    Shen](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/weinings/edu/) and Professor [Guangyu
    Hu](https://sites.google.com/site/nealguanyu/) to cluster players based on
    offensive contributions.

+ Micro-Randomized Trials with Binary Outcomes
    + 
    Co-writing `mrtbincalc`
    [package](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/package-group9) and [Shiny
    app](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/shiny-group5) for power and sample
    size calculations in the context of micro-randomized trials with binary
    outcomes with Thabat Dahdoul under the direction of Professor [Tianchen
    Qian](https://sites.google.com/view/tianchen-qian/). Both are currently
    under development. `mrtbincalc` will later be posted on CRAN and the Shiny
    app will be deployed soon as well. The formula that is implemented in this
    package and shiny app is developed in ["Sample Size Considerations for
    Micro-Randomized Trials with Binary
    Outcome"](https://sites.google.com/view/tianchen-qian/research) which is
    currently a work in progress.


+ Radiomics
    +  
    Worked with Professor [Michele Guindani](http://www.micheleguindani.info/)
    in collaboration with UC Davis scientists on analyzing radiomic data for
    predicting skin cancer. Performed variable selection and fit logistic
    regression models to provide quantitative evidence for examining certain
    traits in imaging data.

# UC San Diego
+ Medical Imaging
    +  
    Implemented convolutional neural network for lung segmentation in MRI images
    in the UCSD Pulmonary Imaging Lab under the supervision of Professor [Rui
    Carlos Pereira de Sa](https://profiles.ucsd.edu/ruicarlos.pereiradesa).
