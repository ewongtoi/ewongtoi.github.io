# UC Irvine
1. Sports Analytics
    +
    Analyzing NBA shot chart data with Professor Weining Shen and Professor
    Guangyu Hu to cluster players based on offensive contributions.

1. Micro-Randomized Trials with Binary Outcomes
    + 
    Co-wrote `mrtbincalc`
    [package](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/package-group9) (to be posted on
    CRAN) and [Shiny app](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/shiny-group5) for
    power and sample size calculations for micro-randomized trials with binary
    outcomes. The formula that is implemented in this package and shiny app is
    developed in ["Sample Size Considerations for Micro-Randomized Trials with
    Binary Outcome"](https://sites.google.com/view/tianchen-qian/research) which
    is currently a work in progress.


1. Radiomics
    +  
    Worked with Professor Michele Guindani in collaboration with UC Davis
    scientists on analyzing radiomic data for predicting skin cancer. Performed
    variable selection and fit logistic regression models to provide
    quantitative reasons for examining certain traits in imaging data.

# UC San Diego
1. Medical Imaging
    +  
    Implemented convolutional neural network for lung segmentation in MRI images
    in the UCSD Pulmonary Imaging Lab under the direction fo Professor Rui
    Carlos Pereira de Sa.
