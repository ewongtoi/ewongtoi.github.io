# Projects
+ [Fuel Efficiency](https://github.com/stats295r-fa20/hw1-ewongtoi)
  + Used a linear model to analyze the fuel efficiency of SP98 and E10 fuel. The
    data came from a single driver's personal log of trips in a single vehicle
    over the course of a year.

+ [Coronavirus Reproduction Number](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O03W0aG2CuLJuj4XOGX90MJlvaU522Bz/view?usp=sharing)
  + Class project with Isaac Goldstein estimating the reproduction number for
    coronavirus in Hubei province fit to data from early 2020. We applied the
    technique of linear noise approximation to data from early 2020 and fit a
    susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model.
