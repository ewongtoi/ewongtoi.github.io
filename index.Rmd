Welcome to my website. I hope you enjoy it!

I am a second-year PhD student in statistics at UC Irvine. 
I previously received a B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science at UC San Diego in
2019.

My statistical interests lie in computational problems and my personal interests
lie in sports; sometimes these two areas overlap.
