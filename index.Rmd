Welcome to my website. I hope you enjoy it!

I am a fourth-year PhD student in statistics at [UC Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu/) 
where I am advised by Professor [Stephan Mandt](http://www.stephanmandt.com/). I 
previously received a B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science from UC San Diego in 
2019.

My research interests lie in Bayesian deep learning.
