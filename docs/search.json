Both are currently under development. mrtbincalc will later be posted on CRAN and the Shiny app will be deployed soon as well. The formula that is implemented in this package and shiny app is developed in “Sample Size Considerations for Micro-Randomized Trials with Binary Outcome” which is currently a work in progress.\r\n\r\nRadiomics\r\nWorked with Professor Michele Guindani in collaboration with UC Davis scientists on analyzing radiomic data for predicting skin cancer. Performed variable selection and fit logistic regression models to provide quantitative evidence for examining certain traits in imaging data.\r\n\r\nUC San Diego\r\nMedical Imaging\r\nImplemented convolutional neural network for lung segmentation in MRI images in the UCSD Pulmonary Imaging Lab under the supervision of Professor Rui Carlos Pereira de Sa.\r\n\r\n",
