I previously received a B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science at UC San Diego in 2019.\r\nMy statistical interests lie in computational problems and my personal interests lie in sports; sometimes these two areas overlap.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The data came from a single driver’s personal log of trips in a single vehicle over the course of a year.\r\n\r\nCoronavirus Reproduction Number\r\nClass project with Isaac Goldstein estimating the reproduction number for coronavirus in Hubei province fit to data from early 2020. We applied the technique of linear noise approximation to data from early 2020 and fit a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model.\r\n\r\n",

This project is just starting.\r\n\r\nMicro-Randomized Trials with Binary Outcomes\r\nCo-writing mrtbincalc package and Shiny app for power and sample size calculations in the context of micro-randomized trials with binary outcomes with Thabat Dahdoul under the direction of Professor Tianchen Qian. Both are currently under development. mrtbincalc will later be posted on CRAN and the Shiny app will be deployed soon as well. The formula that is implemented in this package and shiny app is developed in “Sample Size Considerations for Micro-Randomized Trials with Binary Outcome” which is currently a work in progress.\r\n\r\nRadiomics\r\nWorked with Professor Michele Guindani in collaboration with UC Davis scientists to analyze radiomic data for predicting skin cancer. Used Bayesian methods to perform variable selection and fit logistic regression models to provide quantitative evidence for examining certain traits in imaging data.\r\n\r\nUC San Diego\r\nMedical Imaging\r\nImplemented convolutional neural network for lung segmentation in MRI images in the UCSD Pulmonary Imaging Lab under the supervision of Professor Rui Carlos Pereira de Sa. This tool was to be put in the post-processing pipeline and alleviate the burden of hand-tagging thousands of MRI images per subject.\r\n\r\n",
