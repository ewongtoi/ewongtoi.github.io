The data came from a single driver’s personal log of trips in a\nsingle vehicle over the course of a year.\n\nCoronavirus\nReproduction Number\nClass project with Isaac Goldstein estimating the reproduction\nnumber for coronavirus in Hubei province fit to data from early 2020. We\napplied the technique of linear noise approximation to data from early\n2020 and fit a susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model.\n\n",
